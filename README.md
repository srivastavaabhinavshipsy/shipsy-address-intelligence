|-------|-------|-------------|
| 90-100% | CONFIDENT | ✅ Address is valid with high confidence |
| 70-89% | LIKELY | 👍 Address is likely valid with minor issues |
| 50-69% | SUSPICIOUS | ⚠️ Address has several issues |
| 0-49% | FAILED | ❌ Address validation failed |

### Scoring Deductions

- Missing street address: -25 points
- Missing city/town: -20 points
- Missing province: -20 points
- Invalid province: -30 points
- Invalid postal code: -15 points
- Missing postal code: -10 points
- Coordinates outside SA: -25 points
- PO Box without number: -10 points
